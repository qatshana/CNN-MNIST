# CNN-MNIST
Different neural networks to classify MNIST set and performance measurement for each

# 5-Layers NN with RELU Activation Function
Spec for each layer:
K=200 
L=100
M=60
N=30
Connectign layer=10

With 5000 iternation for a batch of 100 and learning rate of .1, we acheived a 0.9571 accuracy. Please see figure below more deails on the improvment in accuracy as number of iteration increases
